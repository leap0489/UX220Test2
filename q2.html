        <h1>How the Action attribute works</h1>
        <h2>... in my own words</h2>
        <p>
            The Action attribute is used in forms to specify the server program or script which is going to be used to process the data entered into the form. An example is if we create a search box and specify the Action attribute to results.html, then the keyword that we enter in the search will be looked for within the results.html page and presented back to us.
